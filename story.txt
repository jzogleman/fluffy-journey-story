There once was a fluffy bunny who lived in a burrow at the edge of a forest. He was always told never to leave the forest. He would always wonder what was on the other side of the woods. 
One day the fluffy bunny came across a sly fox at the edge of the woods, but remembering what he was told he hopped back to his burrow. The fluffy bunny continued to see this fox simply 
staring at him from the edge of the woods, not making a move towards him, when he worked up the courage and asked "What are you doing, Mr. Fox?" 
The fox responded, "Why I am simply enjoying the warm sun on my back, out of the shade of the forest." Slowly, the fluffy bunny inched closer and closer to the edge of the woods, ready to 
run at a moment's notice. "Wow it is pretty warm out there." The bunny said with a smile; when all of a sudden.... the fox dashed at him! Terrified for his life, the bunny turned tail and
escaped into the woods as fast as his little legs would take him. He thought to himself, "Why didn't I listen to the others?" The bunny never even looked behind him, in fear that it would
slow him down enough for the fox to catch him. Bunny scurried back to the thicket where he lived with his brother and sister bunnies. Flying in at record speeds, he tumbled past his family. Their words of advice rang through his head as he felt remorse for going against their will, but they just looked at him and laughed. Then the fox poked his nose into their den smiling and making eye contact with the parent bunnies. It was then that the child bunny realized his parents and the fox were in this together. Bunny took his scolding, realizing that if it had been a mean fox, his choice to leave home could have ended on a much worst note.
