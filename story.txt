There once was a fluffy bunny who lived in a burrow at the edge of a forest. He was always told never to leave the forest. He would always wonder what was on the other side of the woods. One day the fluffy bunny came across a sly fox at the edge of the woods, but remembering what he was told he hopped back to his burrow. The fluffy bunny continued to see this fox simply staring at him from the edge of the woods, not making a move towards him, when he worked up the courage and asked "What are you doing, Mr. Fox?" 
The fox responded, "Why I am simply enjoying the warm sun on my back, out of the shade of the forest." Slowly, the fluffy bunny inched closer and closer to the edge of the woods, ready to run at a moment's notice. "Wow it is pretty warm out there." The bunny said with a smile; when all of a sudden.... The Fox lunged forward. But the lunge wasn't at bunny, rather behind him. Surprised, bunny looked behind him to see the fox's claws on a snake. Bunny yipped, "You almost scared me out of my fur!", towards fox. Fox calmly responded with, "This is why your parents told you to stay home. You've got to be more careful". Still startled, bunny started his trek back home.
